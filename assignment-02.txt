Assignment 2

1.
a. 0 < pi < 10
b. 7 <= p < 12
c. 5 < x < 7
d. x < 4
e. -3 < y < 3
f. x = 0

2.
a. Pi is greater than 0 and less than 10.
b. p is greater than or equal to 7 and less than 12.
c. x is greater than 5 and less than 7.
d. x is less than 4.
e. y is greater than -3 and less than 3.
f. x is zero.

3.
Loop through the conjuncts. If all are true, the conjunction is true.

4.
Loop through the conjuncts. Stop at the first false conjunct, the conjunction is false.

5.
a. pi > 3
b. x != 0
c. x >= 0
d. x >= 0
e. -3 > x > 3

6.
a. Pi is greater than 3
b. x is not equal to zero
c. x is greater than or equal to zero
d. x is greater than or equal to zero
e. x is less than -3 or greater than 3

7.
Loop through the disjuncts. Stop at the first true disjunct, the disjunction is true.

8.
Loop through the disjuncts. If all disjuncts are false, the disjunction is false.

9.
a. pi <= 3.2
b. x >= 0
c. x = 0
d. x != 1
e. psi

10.
a. Pi is less than or equal to 3.2
