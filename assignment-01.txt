The original sentence is "NO HEAD INJURY IS TOO TRIVIAL TO IGNORE". The problem with this is that the structure "No [noun] is too [adjective] to [verb]" means "Any [noun], no matter how [adjective] can [verb]. For example, "No child is too small to play the Giant" means any child, no matter how small, can play that role in the school play (they probably have a great costume maker).

So, the original sentence is erroneous, because it is actually saying that all head injuries, no matter how trivial, should be ignored. My versions for reformulating the sentence are:

No head injury, even if trivial, should be ignored.

4.

Temperature is just a number indicating how hot or cold something is. Therefore, the statement "The temperature is hot today" suggests that the number itself is somehow hot (to the touch?). A more accurate sentence would be "The temperature is high today."
